## Technical Details and Story
Enmar started as a passion project to bring quality education to students in Eritrean and Ethiopian regions with limited access. The technical challenges we faced included integrating videos into the platform, creating an intuitive user interface, and implementing a robust backend to handle user data securely.

## Key Features
1. <u>Interactive Lessons</u>: Each lesson can contain text, video, and interactive elements.

2. <u>User Profiles</u>: Users can manage their profiles, track progress, and view completed courses.

3. <u>Instructor Dashboard</u>: Instructors can create, update, and delete courses and lessons.

## Future Enhancements
1. <u> Mobile App</u>: Develop a mobile application to make Enmar accessible on-the-go.

2. <u>Multilingual Support</u>: Add support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience.

3. <u>Gamification</u>: Implement gamification elements to enhance user engagement.

## Challenges and Learnings
Building Enmar taught us a lot about web development, user experience, and project management. One of the main challenges was integrating real-time features such as progress tracking. Through this project, we've grown significantly as developers and are excited to continue improving Enmar.

Thank you for checking out Enmar! We hope it serves as a valuable resource for learners and educators alike.
